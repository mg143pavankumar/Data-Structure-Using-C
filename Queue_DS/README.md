# Queue Data Structure
+ __Queue is a linear data structure__ in which the insertion and deletion operations are performed at __two different ends__.
+ In a queue data structure, adding and removing of elements are performed at two different positions.
+ The insertion is performed at one end and deletion is performed at other end.
+ In a queue data structure, the __insertion operation__ is performed at a position which is known as __'rear'__.
+ And the __deletion operation__ is performed at a position which is known as __'front'__.
+ In queue data structure, the insertion and deletion operations are performed based on __FIFO (First In First Out) principle__.


+ In a queue data structure, the insertion operation is performed using a function called __"enQueue()"__.
+ Deletion operation is performed using a function called __"deQueue()"__.

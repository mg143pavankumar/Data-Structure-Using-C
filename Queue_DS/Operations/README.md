# Operations on a Queue

The following operations are performed on a queue data structure...
1.	enQueue(value) - (To insert an element into the queue)
2.	deQueue() - (To delete an element from the queue)
3.	display() - (To display the elements of the queue)

Queue data structure can be implemented in two ways. They are as follows...
1.	Using Array
2.	Using Linked List

+ When a queue is implemented using array, that queue can organize only __limited number of elements__.
+ When a queue is implemented using linked list, that queue can organize __unlimited number of elements__.
